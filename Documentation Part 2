Part 2: 
    - Used code from class 4/17 to connect bot to discord and tested was working
    - Created base of response.py based off of github example of chatbot.
    - Used class example for bot and customized it. 
    - Found dataset from kaggle on Lebron stats. Convinced ChatGPT Lebron was the 
        GOAT. I found it very funny, and very hostile at times.
