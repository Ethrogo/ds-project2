Part 1: 
    -First built 2 functions, tested fetch_data and run_every_minute to see
        Factor, pi, and time, were variables returned. 
    -Used ChatGPT to generate sql_create_records_table statement and created 
        prj-data.db. Also created create_connection and tested it. 
    -insert data built and works, tested with run_every_minute in system test 
        with evidence of 60 minutes in prj-data.db
    -Analysis and visualization built and tested tediously. Various sources 
        used for specific syntax and gpt used for tools for visualization. 
    -Statement: 
        The factor increases with the accuracy of pi. To measure this, I used
        a Pearson correlation coefficient between
        log(factor) and log(pi deviation) is: -0.9999681002798192
        This shows the two are almost perfectly inversely related.
        My explanation for this is from the data, where factor is 1 
        and pi is 4. As factor increases to 8, pi decreases to 
        3.0170718. Pi continues increasing in accuracy while 
        factor increases rapidly. It is also worth comparing
        (which I could not get working) time vs factor to see if an 
        exponential or linear curve fits better.
